## 1 River problem:

**River sharing, river pollution disposal**: Economic, Marketing, Game theory, Hydrology, Environmentology, Chemistry. $\Rightarrow$ relationship to **Management**? (OM, MS, MSOM, ...)

Sustainable: Environmentally and Socially Responsible
- Angell and Klassen (1999): Integrating environmental issues into the mainstream: An agenda for research in operations management
- Kleindorfer et al. (2005):  Consider the environmental and resource consequences of the products and services firms offer and the processes they deploy
- Corbett and Klassen (2006): Increased efficiency through management and behavioural change ----- **lean and green management**

## 2 Closed-loop supply chain

Circular economy: "take-make-dispose" $\Rightarrow$  regenerates and restores materials, products, and energy in a system

- Management of consumer returns: how consumer return decisions can be affected by sales effort
- Remanufacturing: the sale of new products, the fulfillment of warranty needs, and safe waste disposal
- Recycling: system for improved operational and environmental efficiency

## 3 Low-carbon economy

Energy, Emissions, Climate change

- § Carbon emission regulation: carbon tax, carbon cap-andtrade systems, carbon footprint reporting, and accounting mechanisms
- Clean production technologies: incentivize industrial upgrading
- § Renewable energy strategies: marketing decisions between renewable and traditional energy sources

## 4 Environmental management and performance

-  § Environmental resource allocation
- § Pollution control
- Management standard: International Organization for Standardization [ISO]

## 5 Innovation

- Process improvement
- The development and adoption of advanced technologies
- Creative designs of products or services
- § Sustainable business model innovation: crowdsourcing in logistics service offerings and sharing ecomony models

## 7 Sustainable operation research

- The low-carbon economy stream will have significantly expanded and overlapped with the innovation stream: Climate change demands the engagement of the business community in both **adaptation and mitigation**. Adaptation for companies involves adjusting how they **manage their supply chains**, **site their facilities**, **adjust their mix of products and services**, and measure and report on their impacts **in light of physical risks** and regulatory changes related to climate change. 
- The social responsibility stream will have significantly expanded: Climate change has disproportionate implications for the most vulnerable populations through such pathways as **food insecurity, health impacts, and population displacement**. In such areas as agriculture or fishing, the **“far end” of the supply chain** includes a large number of **small-scale contributors living in poverty** and using subsistence practices that collectively impose harm on the environment. 
- Emerging technologies will open new research areas: **digital revolution** —— smart city,
